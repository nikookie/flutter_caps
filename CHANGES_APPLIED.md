# Universal Wood Classification - Changes Applied ✅

## Summary
Successfully converted the wood classification system from species-specific to **universal** (works for all wood types) and added **defects detection** functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Universal Classification System ✅
**File:** `lib/main.dart`

**Method:** `_getWoodQuality()` (Line ~1450)
- **REMOVED:** All species-based checks (oak, mahogany, teak, walnut, cherry, maple, pine, cedar, fir, birch)
- **ADDED:** Universal confidence-only thresholds:
  - **≥ 85%**: Good Wood - High reliability
  - **75-84%**: Good Wood - Generally suitable (verify defects/moisture)
  - **60-74%**: Poor Wood - Manual verification required
  - **< 60%**: Poor Wood - Low certainty

### 2. Universal Quality Basis ✅
**Method:** `_getQualityBasis()` (Line ~1490)
- **REMOVED:** Premium hardwoods list, quality softwoods list, species matching logic
- **ADDED:** Pure confidence-based rules with explanations:
  - Confidence ≥ 85% → high reliability
  - Confidence 75–84% → generally suitable
  - Confidence 60–74% → manual verification required
  - Confidence < 60% → low certainty

### 3. Defects Detection System ✅
**New Method:** `_getDetectedDefects(double confidence)`
- Returns heuristic defect checklist based on confidence
- **6 Defect Categories:**
  1. **Small knots** - OK if < 1" diameter
  2. **Hairline cracks** - OK if superficial
  3. **Warp/Twist** - Slight warp workable
  4. **Discoloration/Blue stain** - Usually cosmetic
  5. **Insect holes** - Check for active infestation
  6. **Moisture risk** - Target 6-12% for interior

- **Status Levels:**
  - ✅ **OK** (Green) - Acceptable for use
  - ⚠️ **Attention** (Orange) - Requires inspection
  - ❌ **Not OK** (Red) - Not recommended

### 4. Defect Row Widget ✅
**New Method:** `_buildDefectRow(Map<String, String> d)`
- Displays each defect with:
  - Color-coded status badge
  - Icon (check/warning/error)
  - Defect name
  - Usage note/recommendation

### 5. Enhanced Dialog ✅
**Method:** `_showQualityBasisDialog()`
- **Added:** ScrollView for longer content
- **Added:** Divider before defects section
- **Added:** "Defects check" header with bug icon
- **Added:** All 6 defect rows with status indicators
- Shows complete basis: rule + reasons + defects

### 6. User Interface Updates ✅
- "View basis" button remains on GOOD/POOR WOOD banner
- Tapping opens dialog with:
  - Universal rule applied
  - Confidence-based reasons
  - Complete defects checklist
  - Color-coded status for each defect

## How It Works Now

### Classification Logic
```
IF confidence ≥ 85%:
  → GOOD WOOD (high reliability)
  
ELSE IF confidence ≥ 75%:
  → GOOD WOOD (generally suitable, verify defects)
  
ELSE IF confidence ≥ 60%:
  → POOR WOOD (manual verification required)
  
ELSE:
  → POOR WOOD (low certainty)
```

### Defects Status Logic
Each defect has two thresholds:
- **Good threshold**: Above this = OK
- **Caution threshold**: Between thresholds = Attention
- **Below caution**: Not OK

Example for "Hairline cracks":
- Confidence ≥ 85% → OK
- Confidence 60-84% → Attention
- Confidence < 60% → Not OK

## Benefits

### 1. Universal Application
- ✅ Works for ANY wood species
- ✅ No need to maintain species lists
- ✅ Consistent across all wood types
- ✅ Easier to maintain and update

### 2. Transparency
- ✅ Users see exact confidence thresholds
- ✅ Clear explanation of classification
- ✅ Defects checklist helps manual verification
- ✅ Educational for users

### 3. Practical Guidance
- ✅ 6 common defects covered
- ✅ Actionable notes for each defect
- ✅ Color-coded for quick assessment
- ✅ Helps users make informed decisions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with various confidence levels:**
   - High (≥ 85%): Should show mostly OK defects
   - Medium (75-84%): Should show mix of OK/Attention
   - Low (60-74%): Should show Attention/Not OK
   - Very low (< 60%): Should show mostly Not OK

2. **Verify dialog display:**
   - Tap "View basis" button
   - Check all 6 defects appear
   - Verify color coding matches status
   - Ensure scrolling works for long content

3. **Test with different wood species:**
   - Acacia, Mahogany, Narra, etc.
   - All should use same universal rules
   - No species-specific behavior

## Files Modified

- ✅ `lib/main.dart` - Main classification logic
- ✅ Added 3 new methods for defects
- ✅ Updated 2 existing methods for universal classification
- ✅ Enhanced 1 dialog method

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing scans in history will work
- ✅ UI remains the same
- ✅ Only classification logic changed
- ✅ No breaking changes to data structure

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add more defect categories
2. Adjust confidence thresholds based on feedback
3. Add defect severity levels
4. Include photos/examples of defects
5. Add moisture meter integration
6. Include grain pattern analysis
